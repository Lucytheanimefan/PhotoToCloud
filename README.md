# PhotoToCloud

An iOS app that automatically uploads your photos to the cloud. Made for people who only have 5 GB of iCloud storage and need to save their photos somewhere.

## Current functionality
* Login/authentication with Flickr
* Any photo you take is automatically uploaded to Flickr
* Push notifications on successful upload

## Future Features
* Uploading pictures automatically to: Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, etc. (And a settings view to configure all of this)
* Smarter detection of new photos vs. modified photos.
* It's pretty ugly right now.
